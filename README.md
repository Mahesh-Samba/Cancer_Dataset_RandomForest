Random Forest on Breast Cancer Dataset (Classification)
I analyzed the breast cancer dataset using EDA techniques, including a heatmap to visualize feature correlations and pair plots to explore relationships and distributions across target classes. Joint plots further illustrated feature distributions by target class. After splitting the data into training and testing sets, I conducted hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest Classifier using GridSearchCV, optimizing parameters such as n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, and min_samples_leaf. The best model achieved a high cross-validation accuracy score, validated on the test set using a classification report that detailed precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for each class (cancer.target_names). This approach ensures robust model performance and insightful analysis of breast cancer classification.
